# x86-Injector
A x86 DLL Injector with GUI. Because GUI is nice.

Functionality:
- Select file from dialog
- Iterates all windows in one click
- Copy the window title of any window
- Allows minimizing the window to the system tray area
- And, of course, it can inject x86 DLLs into x86 processes
- Made in C++. Only scriptkiddies use C#
